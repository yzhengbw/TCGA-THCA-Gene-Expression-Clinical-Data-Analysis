# üß¨ TCGA-THCA Clinical & Gene Expression Analysis Pipeline

This project provides a complete bioinformatics workflow based on the TCGA-THCA (Thyroid Carcinoma) dataset. It integrates clinical metadata and RNA-seq gene expression data to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA), differential expression analysis (DEA), dimensionality reduction (PCA), clustering, and functional enrichment analysis (GO).

## üß™ Workflow Summary

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removed duplicated clinical entries
- Checked and handled missing values
- Aligned sample IDs between clinical and expression datasets

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized clinical parameters (age, gender distributions)
- Heatmap and distribution plots of gene expression data

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Dimensionality Reduction
- Applied **PCA** on normalized gene expression data
- Plotted PC1 vs PC2 to reveal variance patterns

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering
- Used **KMeans clustering** on principal components
- Evaluated clustering performance via silhouette score

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Differential Expression Analysis (DEA)
- Used **DESeq2** to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between groups
- Volcano plot to visualize log2 fold change vs adjusted p-value
- Extracted top DEGs for downstream analysis

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ GO Enrichment Analysis
- Performed functional enrichment (Gene Ontology) on top DEGs
- Identified overrepresented biological processes and pathways using **GSEApy**
